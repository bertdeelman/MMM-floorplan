Magic Mirror Module: MMM-floorplan

This MagicMirror2 module allows you to show a floorplan of your house / apartment with the current state of PIR motion sensors, lights, door/window contacts, gates and labels provided by messages on a series of MQTT message queues. The display is updated as soon as the MQTT message is seen on the queue.

Based on https://github.com/DMailMan/MMM-MQTTfloorplan but with icons. https://rawgit.com/james-fry/home-assistant-mdi/master/home-assistant-mdi.html
